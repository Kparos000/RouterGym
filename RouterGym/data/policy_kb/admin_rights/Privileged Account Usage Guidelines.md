# Privileged Account Usage Guidelines

**Category:** Administrative rights  

## Description
Rules for using privileged accounts (server admin, database admin, security tools).

## Typical Ticket Patterns
- “Which account should I use for this task?”
- “Need runbook for admin tasks”
- “Shared admin credentials question”

## Resolution Steps
1. Clarify which privileged accounts exist for the system in question.
2. Explain that admin accounts are for admin tasks only, not day-to-day usage.
3. Require multi-factor authentication and session logging where supported.
4. Direct users to standard runbooks for common admin actions.
5. Record privileged actions in change/incident records where appropriate.

## When to Escalate
- Shared credentials discovered without proper control.
- High-risk changes without approvals.
- Suspected misuse of admin privileges.
