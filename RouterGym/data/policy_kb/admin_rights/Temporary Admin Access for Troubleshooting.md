# Temporary Admin Access for Troubleshooting

**Category:** Administrative rights  

## Description
Short-term admin access used to diagnose or fix specific issues.

## Typical Ticket Patterns
- “Need admin for one-off fix”
- “Temporary rights to run script”
- “Short-term access to logs”

## Resolution Steps
1. Confirm the exact task and expected duration (ideally hours, not days).
2. Grant access using time-bound groups or just-in-time tooling.
3. Monitor actions taken where feasible (logs, screen sharing).
4. Remove rights immediately after the task is complete.
5. Record what was changed and outcomes in the ticket.

## When to Escalate
- Tasks that may impact many users or systems.
- Repeated temporary requests that indicate permanent need.
- Troubleshooting in regulated or sensitive environments.
