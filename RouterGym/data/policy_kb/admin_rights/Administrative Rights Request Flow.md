# Administrative Rights Request Flow

**Category:** Administrative rights  

## Description
Workflow for granting local admin or elevated application rights.

## Typical Ticket Patterns
- “Need admin rights to install tools”
- “Developer access to system files”
- “Temporary admin for troubleshooting”

## Resolution Steps
1. Confirm request comes from the user’s manager or system owner.
2. Validate business justification and duration of access.
3. Map request to standard admin profiles (local admin, app admin, database admin).
4. Apply rights using approved tools; avoid shared admin accounts where possible.
5. Document scope, duration, and approvals in the ticket.

## When to Escalate
- Requests for domain admin or global privileges.
- Conflicts with security policy or audit findings.
- Repeated admin requests from same user/team.
