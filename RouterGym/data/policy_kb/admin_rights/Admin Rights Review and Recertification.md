# Admin Rights Review and Recertification

**Category:** Administrative rights  

## Description
Periodic review to validate that existing admin rights are still required and appropriate.

## Typical Ticket Patterns
- “Quarterly admin access review”
- “Audit of privileged accounts”
- “Need list of admins for system X”

## Resolution Steps
1. Generate list of users and groups with admin rights per system.
2. Send to system owners and managers for review and confirmation.
3. Remove or downgrade access that is no longer justified.
4. Record approvals and changes for audit purposes.
5. Schedule next review according to policy.

## When to Escalate
- System owners do not respond to review requests.
- Excessive or unjustified admin rights found.
- Findings that require reporting to risk committees or regulators.
