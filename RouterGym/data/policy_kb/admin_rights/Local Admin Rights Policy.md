# Local Admin Rights Policy

**Category:** Administrative rights  

## Description
Defines when and how local administrator rights may be granted on workstations.

## Typical Ticket Patterns
- “Need local admin to install drivers”
- “Cannot run tool without admin rights”
- “Question about local admin policy”

## Resolution Steps
1. Explain that local admin is an exception, not default.
2. Review user role and whether a non-admin workaround is available.
3. Grant time-bound local admin rights using approved mechanism if justified.
4. Educate user on safe usage and responsibility for changes.
5. Schedule or trigger removal of admin rights once work is complete.

## When to Escalate
- Long-term or permanent local admin requested.
- Users with access to sensitive data or systems.
- Past security incidents involving the same user/team.
