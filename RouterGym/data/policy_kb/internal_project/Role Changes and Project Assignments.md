# Role Changes and Project Assignments

**Category:** Internal Project  

## Description
Adjusting access when staff join, leave, or change roles within a project.

## Typical Ticket Patterns
- “Add developer to project X”
- “Remove user from internal project”
- “Promote user to project lead role”

## Resolution Steps
1. Verify project membership change with project manager.
2. Update relevant groups (source control, ticketing, environments).
3. Remove access for users leaving the project and adjust shared credentials.
4. Confirm new permissions allow required tasks, but no unnecessary admin rights.
5. Document changes in project access log.

## When to Escalate
- Access to production or sensitive data.
- Disagreements over who should have what level of access.
- Large project team changes during critical milestones.
