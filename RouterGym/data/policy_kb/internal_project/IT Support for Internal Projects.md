# IT Support for Internal Projects

**Category:** Internal Project  

## Description
Defining how IT supports internal projects with environments, tooling, and incident handling.

## Typical Ticket Patterns
- “New internal project needs IT setup”
- “Who supports project environment?”
- “Escalation path for project issues”

## Resolution Steps
1. Confirm project sponsor, manager, and expected duration.
2. Identify required systems (repositories, CI/CD, databases, test/stage).
3. Assign a primary IT contact or support group.
4. Define support hours, incident severity, and escalation contacts.
5. Document project setup and support model in a shared location.

## When to Escalate
- Projects with external clients or regulatory impact.
- Cross-department dependencies not clearly owned.
- Large infrastructure or security design changes.
