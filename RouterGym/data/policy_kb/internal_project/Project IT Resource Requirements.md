# Project IT Resource Requirements

**Category:** Internal Project  

## Description
Capturing the infrastructure and tooling needs of a new internal project.

## Typical Ticket Patterns
- “Need VM and database for project”
- “Request for test environment and storage”
- “Need CI/CD pipeline for new app”

## Resolution Steps
1. Collect basic project details: stack, environments (dev/test/prod), users.
2. Estimate compute, storage, and network requirements.
3. Map requirements to standard platforms (cloud, on-prem, shared services).
4. Raise necessary provisioning requests and track completion.
5. Share resource overview and access details with the project team.

## When to Escalate
- Non-standard technology stacks or external hosting.
- Significant cost or capacity impact.
- Security or data-classification concerns.
