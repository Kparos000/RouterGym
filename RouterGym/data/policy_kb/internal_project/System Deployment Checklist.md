## Typical Ticket Patterns

- “Pre-deployment checks”

## Resolution Steps

2. Validate backup/rollback plan and test coverage.
3. Ensure monitoring, logging, and alerting are configured.
4. Execute deployment steps or support dev team during deployment.
5. Run smoke tests and confirm key user journeys function.

## When to Escalate
