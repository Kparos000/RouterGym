# Data Access and Security for Project Teams

**Category:** Internal Project  

## Description
Ensuring project teams can access required data sets while complying with security and privacy rules.

## Typical Ticket Patterns
- “Need dataset for analytics project”
- “Cannot access data warehouse table”
- “Request for production logs”

## Resolution Steps
1. Confirm data owner and purpose of use.
2. Classify requested data (public, internal, confidential, personal).
3. Choose appropriate access method (read-only views, masked data, anonymised extracts).
4. Apply access via roles or views and log approvals.
5. Review access regularly and remove when project ends.

## When to Escalate
- Requests for sensitive or personal data.
- Cross-region or cross-tenant data transfers.
- Conflicts between project needs and data-protection policies.
