# IT Equipment Procurement Policy

**Category:** Purchase  

## Description
High-level rules for purchasing standard IT equipment (laptops, monitors, peripherals).

## Typical Ticket Patterns
- “Can I order my own laptop?”
- “What is the standard model?”
- “Need approval rules for equipment”

## Resolution Steps
1. Describe approved hardware catalogue and standard models by role.
2. Explain who can approve new equipment (manager, budget owner, IT).
3. Clarify purchase channels (service portal, procurement system).
4. Outline lead times and refresh cycle guidelines.
5. Link to detailed procedures for ordering and replacements.

## When to Escalate
- Requests for non-standard or custom equipment.
- Exceptions to budget or refresh policy.
- Bulk or project-specific orders.
