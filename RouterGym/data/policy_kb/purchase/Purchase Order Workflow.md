# Purchase Order Workflow

**Category:** Purchase  

## Description
How IT and business users create, approve, and track purchase orders (POs) for IT items.

## Typical Ticket Patterns
- “PO stuck in pending state”
- “Cannot add IT item to PO”
- “Need PO number for vendor”

## Resolution Steps
1. Verify requester has access to procurement system.
2. Check PO status (draft, awaiting approval, approved, closed).
3. Ensure correct cost centre, GL code, and vendor are selected.
4. Guide user through fixing validation errors and resubmitting.
5. Confirm PO approval and share PO number with requester.

## When to Escalate
- System-wide procurement outages.
- POs failing due to budget or policy blocks.
- Urgent purchases blocked near critical deadlines.
