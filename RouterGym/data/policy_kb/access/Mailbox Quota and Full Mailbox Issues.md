# Mailbox Quota and Full Mailbox Issues

**Category:** Access  

## Description
Handling full or nearly full mailboxes and quota warnings.

## Typical Ticket Patterns
- “Mailbox full, cannot send email”
- “Quota warning messages”
- “Need larger mailbox”

## Resolution Steps
1. Confirm current mailbox size vs assigned quota.
2. Help user archive or delete large items (sent folder, old attachments).
3. Configure retention/archive policies as per corporate standard.
4. Where justified, request a quota increase from mail admin with business reason.
5. Confirm mailbox returns to normal operation.

## When to Escalate
- Executives or shared mailboxes that cannot be reduced easily.
- Global retention or archive policies incorrectly applied.
- Legal hold on mailbox content.
