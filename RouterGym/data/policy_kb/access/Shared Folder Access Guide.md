# Shared Folder Access Guide

**Category:** Access  

## Description
Requests to access shared drives or project folders used by a team or application.

## Typical Ticket Patterns
- “Cannot open shared folder on server”
- “Need access to team drive”
- “Access denied to project documents”

## Resolution Steps
1. Confirm folder path and owning team or application.
2. Validate manager or data owner approval for access.
3. Add user to the appropriate AD group or permissions ACL.
4. Ask user to log off and back on or reconnect mapped drive.
5. Verify read/write access as requested; avoid full control unless required.

## When to Escalate
- Sensitive folders (finance, HR, legal).
- Many users lose access after system or migration changes.
- Permissions inheritance issues affecting nested folders.
