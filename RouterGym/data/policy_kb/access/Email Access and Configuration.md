# Email Access and Configuration

**Category:** Access  

## Description
Ensuring users can access corporate email on desktops, web, and mobile devices.

## Typical Ticket Patterns
- “Cannot add mailbox to Outlook”
- “Email not syncing on phone”
- “Shared mailbox missing”

## Resolution Steps
1. Confirm mailbox exists and is licensed/active.
2. Check that user has the correct mailbox permissions (own mailbox, shared mailboxes).
3. Configure email profile using standard auto-discovery settings.
4. For mobile, confirm approved mail client and security policies (MDM, device encryption).
5. Sync mail and confirm sending/receiving works.

## When to Escalate
- Large numbers of users with mail sync issues.
- Corrupt mailbox or suspected mail data loss.
- Regulatory/legal holds preventing mailbox changes.
