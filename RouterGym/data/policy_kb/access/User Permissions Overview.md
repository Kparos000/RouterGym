# User Permissions Overview

**Category:** Access  

## Description
Reference guide explaining standard permission models for common systems.

## Typical Ticket Patterns
- “What permissions should a new analyst get?”
- “Difference between read and contribute in SharePoint?”
- “Why can’t I delete files in this folder?”

## Resolution Steps
1. Document common role profiles per system (e.g., employee, manager, admin).
2. Explain how group-based access, least privilege, and separation of duties are applied.
3. Provide examples of what each role can and cannot do.
4. Link to detailed policies for privileged accounts and admin rights.
5. Use this guide to answer general permission questions in tickets.

## When to Escalate
- Requests to deviate from standard roles.
- Conflicts between business needs and security standards.
- New systems without defined permission models.
