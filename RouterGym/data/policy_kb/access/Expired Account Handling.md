# Expired Account Handling

**Category:** Access  

## Description
Managing accounts for contractors, interns, and dormant users when access expires.

## Typical Ticket Patterns
- “Account expired – cannot log in”
- “Contract extended, need access restored”
- “Account disabled after long leave”

## Resolution Steps
1. Check HR or contractor records for true end date vs requested extension.
2. If user is still active, extend account expiration date per policy and re-enable access.
3. If user is no longer active, confirm deprovisioning and ensure all access is removed.
4. For returning users, consider creating a new account if deprovisioning was completed long ago.
5. Update ticket with final account status and actions taken.

## When to Escalate
- Unclear employment status or missing HR records.
- Legal or compliance holds on user data.
- High-risk systems (finance, security) involved.
