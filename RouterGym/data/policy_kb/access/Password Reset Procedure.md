**Category:** Access  

## Description
Resetting user passwords for AD, email, VPN, and primary business applications.

## Typical Ticket Patterns
- “Forgot my password”
- “Password expired over the weekend”
- “Account locked after too many attempts”

## Resolution Steps
1. Verify user identity using approved security checks.
2. Confirm which system password requires reset.
3. Use official password reset tooling (self-service or service desk) to generate a new password or unlock.
4. Ensure password meets complexity and history requirements.
5. Ask user to log into primary device and test SSO into key applications.

## When to Escalate
- Suspicious account activity or potential compromise.
- Multiple users reporting password failures for one system.
