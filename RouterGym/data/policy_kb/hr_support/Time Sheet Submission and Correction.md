# Time Sheet Submission and Correction

**Category:** HR Support  

## Description
Issues with entering, submitting, or correcting hours worked in the time-reporting system.

## Typical Ticket Patterns
- “Cannot submit my timesheet”
- “Time entry screen blank”
- “Incorrect hours submitted – need to amend”

## Resolution Steps
1. Confirm the correct time-reporting system and period (week, month).
2. Check that the user is assigned to the correct cost centre/project.
3. Validate that the timesheet is open for editing and not locked by payroll.
4. Guide the user through correcting entries or raise a request for admin correction.
5. Confirm the recalculated totals and approval status.

## When to Escalate
- Pay has already been processed with incorrect hours.
- Timesheet workflow errors affecting multiple users.
- Role or project assignments missing in HR data.
