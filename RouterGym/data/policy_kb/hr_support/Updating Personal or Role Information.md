# Updating Personal or Role Information

**Category:** HR Support  

## Description
Changes to name, contact details, department, manager, or job title that impact IT systems.

## Typical Ticket Patterns
- “Surname changed after marriage”
- “New manager not shown in system”
- “Role changed from contractor to employee”

## Resolution Steps
1. Confirm HR has received and approved the underlying change (e.g., name change, promotion).
2. Validate that HR master data has been updated correctly.
3. Sync changes to downstream systems (AD, email display name, distribution lists).
4. Ensure reporting lines and approval workflows are updated.
5. Notify the user and manager once all systems show the correct details.

## When to Escalate
- Conflicting information between HR and payroll systems.
- Frequent sync failures for this user or department.
- Sensitive changes (e.g., legal name, gender markers) needing privacy review.
