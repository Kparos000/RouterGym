# Probation, Promotion and Role Change IT Updates

**Category:** HR Support  

## Description
Updating IT access and systems when an employee passes probation, is promoted, or changes role.

## Typical Ticket Patterns
- “Employee passed probation – update access”
- “Moved from contractor to permanent”
- “Promoted to manager, needs new permissions”

## Resolution Steps
1. Confirm HR has recorded the change and effective date.
2. Map new role to standard IT access profile.
3. Add or remove applications, distribution lists, and HR permissions.
4. Validate new permissions with the user and manager.
5. Remove temporary or probationary access that is no longer required.

## When to Escalate
- Disagreement over what access is appropriate.
- Promotions involving sensitive systems (finance, HR, security).
- System sync failures between HR and IT directories.
