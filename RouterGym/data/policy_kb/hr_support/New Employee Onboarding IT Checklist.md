# New Employee Onboarding IT Checklist

**Category:** HR Support  

## Description
Ensuring new starters have the correct accounts, equipment, and access on day one.

## Typical Ticket Patterns
- “New starter not set up in system”
- “No access to HR portal or email”
- “Equipment not ready for start date”

## Resolution Steps
1. Verify start date and role from the HR onboarding request.
2. Confirm core accounts (AD/email/SSO) have been created with the right department and manager.
3. Provision standard hardware kit and confirm shipping or pickup details.
4. Assign default application, HR system, and folder access based on role profile.
5. Test login to email, HR portal, and time-reporting before handover.
6. Share “Getting Started” instructions with the manager and user.
7. Update ticket with completed steps and remaining follow-ups.

## When to Escalate
- Start date has arrived and core access is still missing.
- Conflicting information between HR and hiring manager.
- Special regulatory or privileged roles requiring additional approvals.
