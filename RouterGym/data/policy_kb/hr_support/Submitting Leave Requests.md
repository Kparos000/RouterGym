# Submitting Leave Requests

**Category:** HR Support  

## Description
Helping employees raise and track vacation, sick leave, and other absence requests.

## Typical Ticket Patterns
- “Cannot submit vacation request”
- “Leave request stuck in pending”
- “Manager cannot approve my leave”

## Resolution Steps
1. Verify that the user and manager have active HR portal access.
2. Confirm leave type, dates, and any policy constraints (notice period, balance).
3. Walk through the leave request steps in the HR portal and compare with screenshots.
4. Check workflow assignments and manager hierarchy; correct if misconfigured.
5. Resubmit or re-route stuck requests and confirm new status.
6. Advise user on how to view balances and history.

## When to Escalate
- Approval workflow errors that cannot be corrected by IT.
- Policy exceptions or overlapping leave disputes.
- HR system outage affecting leave approvals.
