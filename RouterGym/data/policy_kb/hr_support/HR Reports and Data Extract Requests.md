# HR Reports and Data Extract Requests

**Category:** HR Support  

## Description
Providing HR reports or data extracts to authorised stakeholders.

## Typical Ticket Patterns
- “Need list of starters/leavers for last month”
- “Manager headcount report requested”
- “Export of HR data for audit”

## Resolution Steps
1. Validate requester’s role and legal basis for accessing HR data.
2. Identify required fields, date ranges, and format (CSV, PDF, dashboard).
3. Use HR reporting tools to generate the report; apply standard filters.
4. Remove unnecessary personally identifiable information where possible.
5. Deliver report via approved secure channels and log recipients.

## When to Escalate
- Requests for sensitive data (salary, performance, health).
- External regulators or legal discovery requests.
