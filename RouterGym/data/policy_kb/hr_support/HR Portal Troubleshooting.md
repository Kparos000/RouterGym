**Category:** HR Support  

## Description
Fixing login or navigation issues in the HR self-service portal.

## Typical Ticket Patterns
- “Error after logging into HR portal”
- “Cannot see my payslips”
- “Leave balance not loading”

## Resolution Steps
1. Confirm portal URL and that the user is using a supported browser.
2. Ask user to clear cache/cookies or try an incognito window.
3. Check SSO / MFA status and ensure HR application is assigned to the user.
4. Verify user profile and employment status in the HR system.
5. Check for known incidents; if none, reproduce issue via test account if possible.

## When to Escalate
- Multiple users reporting same portal issue.
- Payroll or benefits information unavailable near cut-off dates.
- Security or data privacy errors.
