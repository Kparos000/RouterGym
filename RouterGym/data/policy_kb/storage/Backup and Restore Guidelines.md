# Backup and Restore Guidelines

**Category:** Storage  

## Description
How user data is backed up and restored across mailboxes, home drives, and cloud storage.

## Typical Ticket Patterns
- “Need to restore deleted folder”
- “File overwritten by accident”
- “Recover mailbox items from last month”

## Resolution Steps
1. Identify storage system (file server, SharePoint, OneDrive, mailbox).
2. Check backup/retention policy for that system.
3. Locate the relevant restore point or version (date/time).
4. Restore content to a temporary location and notify user.
5. Ask user to confirm restored data before deleting temporary copies.

## When to Escalate
- Legal holds or investigations involving restored data.
- Bulk restores for large projects or departments.
- Backup job failures affecting multiple systems.
