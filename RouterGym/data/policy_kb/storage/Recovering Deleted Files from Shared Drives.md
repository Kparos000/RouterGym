# Recovering Deleted Files from Shared Drives

**Category:** Storage  

## Description
Recovering recently deleted files from shared drives or network folders.

## Typical Ticket Patterns
- “Accidentally deleted project folder”
- “File missing from shared drive”
- “Need to restore yesterday’s changes”

## Resolution Steps
1. Confirm folder path and approximate deletion time.
2. Check recycle bin or snapshot functionality on the file server/NAS.
3. Restore specific files or folders from the relevant snapshot.
4. Place restored items in a clearly named “_Restored_<date>” folder.
5. Advise users to review and reorganize restored content.

## When to Escalate
- Deleted content older than standard retention.
- Multiple deletions across different paths (possible malware/ransomware).
- Recovery requiring offsite or tape backups.
