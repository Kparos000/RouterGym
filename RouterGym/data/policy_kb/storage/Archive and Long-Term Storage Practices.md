# Archive and Long-Term Storage Practices

**Category:** Storage  

## Description
Guidance on archiving inactive data while controlling storage costs and complying with retention rules.

## Typical Ticket Patterns
- “Where should old project files be stored?”
- “Need to archive data before deletion”
- “Cold storage for compliance”

## Resolution Steps
1. Determine data type, size, and required retention duration.
2. Choose appropriate archive location (archive share, cloud cold storage, email archive).
3. Move data following encryption and labelling policies.
4. Register archived data with the owning team and set review dates.
5. Document archive location and access controls in the ticket.

## When to Escalate
- Regulatory retention requirements (e.g., financial, healthcare).
- Very large data sets requiring special handling.
- Cross-region or cross-tenant archive moves.
