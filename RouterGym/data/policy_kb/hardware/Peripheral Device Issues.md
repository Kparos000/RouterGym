# Peripheral Device Issues (Mouse, Keyboard, Dock, etc.)

**Category:** Hardware  

## Description
Non-functioning or intermittent behaviour of mice, keyboards, headsets, docks, and similar peripherals.

## Typical Ticket Patterns
- “Mouse not working when docked”
- “Keyboard randomly stops responding”
- “Headset not detected by laptop”

## Resolution Steps
1. Confirm peripheral is powered (if applicable) and properly connected (USB/Bluetooth).
2. For docks, test with a direct laptop connection to isolate dock vs device.
3. Swap USB port, reboot, and check Device Manager / system settings for errors.
4. Remove and re-pair Bluetooth devices, ensuring only one active connection at a time.
5. Update firmware or drivers for the dock or peripheral if available.
6. Test with a known-good peripheral of the same type to confirm hardware failure.
7. Replace faulty peripherals according to Hardware Replacement Process.

## When to Escalate
- Repeated failures with multiple peripherals on the same port/dock.
- Critical accessibility devices (ergonomic keyboards, special mice) impacted.
- Suspected compatibility issue with corporate image or encryption.
