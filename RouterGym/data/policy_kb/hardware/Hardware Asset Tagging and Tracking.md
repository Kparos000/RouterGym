# Hardware Asset Tagging and Tracking

**Category:** Hardware  

## Description
How IT tracks physical devices (laptops, monitors, docks, printers) using asset tags.

## Typical Ticket Patterns
- “Asset tag not in system”
- “Device assigned to wrong user”
- “Need asset details for audit”

## Resolution Steps
1. Verify physical asset tag and serial number on the device.
2. Search the asset database by tag, serial, and hostname.
3. Correct ownership and location fields if the asset has moved or been reassigned.
4. For new devices, create a record with model, serial, tag, assigned user, and warranty info.
5. For retired devices, ensure they are marked decommissioned with disposal details.
6. Confirm inventory is updated and attach screenshots or audit evidence to the ticket.

## When to Escalate
- Asset discrepancies impacting audit or compliance.
- Suspected lost or stolen equipment.
- Large differences between physical and recorded inventory.
