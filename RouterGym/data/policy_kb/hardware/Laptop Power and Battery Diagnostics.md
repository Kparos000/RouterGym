# Laptop Power and Battery Diagnostics

**Category:** Hardware  

## Description
Laptops that power off unexpectedly, do not charge, or have rapidly draining batteries.

## Typical Ticket Patterns
- “Laptop battery drains in an hour”
- “Charging light not on”
- “Device turns off when disconnected from power”

## Resolution Steps
1. Confirm user is using an approved power adapter and cable; test with a known-good adapter if available.
2. Check OS battery status and health report (e.g., Windows battery report or vendor tool).
3. Ensure power plan is set to “Balanced” or corporate standard, not performance-throttling or custom.
4. Update BIOS/firmware and power-management drivers if versions are outdated.
5. Run vendor battery diagnostics and capture results.
6. If battery health is below policy threshold or diagnostics fail, log details and initiate replacement.
7. Educate user on charging habits and proper shutdown/sleep usage.

## When to Escalate
- Battery or power adapter shows physical damage or overheating.
- Repeated power failures after adapter and battery replacement.
- Firmware update failures.
