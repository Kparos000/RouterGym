# Printer Setup and Common Errors

**Category:** Hardware  

## Description
Issues installing, selecting, or printing to network or local printers.

## Typical Ticket Patterns
- “Cannot print to office printer”
- “Printer offline / not responding”
- “Wrong default printer used”

## Resolution Steps
1. Confirm user’s location and assigned printer; verify printer power and network status.
2. Check if others can print to the same device; if not, log as a wider incident.
3. Remove stale printer queues and re-add the correct printer from the corporate list.
4. Ensure correct printer driver and default settings are applied.
5. Clear stuck jobs from the user’s print queue and the server queue if needed.
6. Print a test page from the user’s device and directly from the printer console.
7. Document steps and confirm the user can print successful test documents.

## When to Escalate
- Multiple users unable to print to the same device.
- Hardware error codes (paper jams, fuser errors) that require onsite/vendor support.
- Secure or high-volume print devices in critical locations.
