# Monitor Display Issues

**Category:** Hardware  

## Description
Problems with built-in or external displays: no signal, flickering, wrong resolution, or colour issues.

## Typical Ticket Patterns
- “Second monitor not detected”
- “No signal on screen”
- “Fuzzy / stretched display”

## Resolution Steps
1. Confirm monitor power, cable connections, and input source (HDMI/DP/USB-C).
2. Ask user to test with a different cable or port where possible.
3. From the OS, detect displays and ensure extended/duplicate mode is correctly configured.
4. Check GPU/display drivers and update if required.
5. For docking stations, test the monitor directly on the laptop to rule out dock issues.
6. If monitor still fails, swap with a known-good monitor to isolate hardware vs configuration.
7. Document the final working configuration or failure symptoms.

## When to Escalate
- Multiple users on same dock/desk report identical issues.
- Monitors fail power-on self test (no power light, burnt smell, visible damage).
- User relies on multi-monitor setup for business-critical workflows and no spare hardware is available.
