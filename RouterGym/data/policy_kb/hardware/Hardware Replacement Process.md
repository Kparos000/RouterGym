# Hardware Replacement Process

**Category:** Hardware  

## Description
Standard process for replacing laptops, desktops, monitors, or key peripherals.

## Typical Ticket Patterns
- “Laptop beyond repair, need replacement”
- “Damaged screen / device dropped”
- “Hardware older than refresh policy”

## Resolution Steps
1. Confirm troubleshooting has been completed (see relevant KB) and that replacement is justified.
2. Check warranty status, asset age, and refresh eligibility in the asset system.
3. Raise a request or purchase order according to IT Equipment Procurement Policy.
4. Assign replacement device and ensure asset tag is updated and linked to the user.
5. Migrate user data from old device via backup/restore process or cloud sync.
6. Wipe and securely dispose of or return the old asset as per policy.
7. Update ticket with new asset ID, warranty details, and handover confirmation.

## When to Escalate

- Data cannot be recovered from failing device.
- Exceptions to standard models or refresh cycle requested.
