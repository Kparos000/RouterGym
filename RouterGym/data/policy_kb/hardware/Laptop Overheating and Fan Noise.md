## Description

## Typical Ticket Patterns

## Resolution Steps

2. Check for blocked vents, dust buildup, or third-party covers obstructing airflow.
3. Review running processes for CPU-intensive apps or malware.
4. Update BIOS and chipset drivers, focusing on thermal / power management updates.
5. Run hardware diagnostics for CPU and fan; capture any error codes.
6. If overheating persists, schedule inspection and possible replacement of thermal paste or fan.
7. Document findings and user guidance.
