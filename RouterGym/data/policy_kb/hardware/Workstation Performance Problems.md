# Workstation Performance Problems (Slow / Freezing)

**Category:** Hardware  

## Description
User reports their workstation is slow, freezing, or unresponsive during normal tasks.

## Typical Ticket Patterns
- “Laptop is very slow”
- “Applications keep freezing”
- “CPU at 100%”

## Resolution Steps
1. Confirm symptoms (slow login, app slowness, network slowness) and frequency.
2. Check available disk space, RAM use, and CPU utilisation; close unnecessary background tasks.
3. Run malware and health checks as per security policy.
4. Ensure OS and key drivers are up-to-date; install pending performance or firmware updates.
5. For persistent issues, test with a clean profile or safe mode.
6. If hardware is older than refresh threshold or fails diagnostics, recommend replacement.
7. Document root cause and remediation (software vs hardware vs profile).

## When to Escalate
- Repeated hangs or blue screens after OS repair.
- Critical users unable to work for more than 30 minutes due to performance.
- Performance issues correlated with a new global deployment.
