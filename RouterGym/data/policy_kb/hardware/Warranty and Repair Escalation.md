# Warranty and Repair Escalation

**Category:** Hardware  

## Description
Managing vendor repairs and warranty claims for faulty hardware.

## Typical Ticket Patterns
- “Laptop still under warranty but failing diagnostics”
- “Need repair authorization”
- “Broken screen / keyboard / hinges”

## Resolution Steps
1. Confirm asset ownership, serial, and warranty status in asset system or vendor portal.
2. Attach diagnostic results, photos, and error codes to the ticket.
3. Log a case with the hardware vendor, including user location and urgency.
4. Coordinate shipment or onsite technician visit with the user and vendor.
5. Track repair progress and provide temporary device where possible.
6. Update ticket with repair reference, ETA, and final completion details.

## When to Escalate
- Vendor misses SLA or repeatedly delays repair.
- Business-critical roles left without functional equipment.
- Safety concerns (e.g., overheating battery, exposed wiring).
