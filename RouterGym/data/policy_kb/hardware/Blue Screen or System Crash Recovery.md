# Blue Screen or System Crash Recovery

**Category:** Hardware  

## Description
Handling intermittent blue screens (BSOD), kernel panics, or sudden system crashes.

## Typical Ticket Patterns
- “Blue screen with error code”
- “System crashes randomly”
- “Automatic repair loop”

## Resolution Steps
1. Capture error codes, mini-dumps, and the approximate time the crash occurs.
2. Check recent driver or OS updates; roll back problematic changes where appropriate.
3. Run memory and disk diagnostics; repair file system errors.
4. If crashes started after new hardware was attached, test without the new device.
5. Apply vendor and OS patches recommended for stability.
6. If crashes persist, build a new corporate image and test; if still failing, initiate replacement.
7. Record root cause if identified (driver, hardware fault, application).

## When to Escalate
- Frequent crashes preventing user from working.
- Reproducible crashes tied to a core business application.
- Suspected hardware defect (RAM, motherboard, SSD) after diagnostics.
