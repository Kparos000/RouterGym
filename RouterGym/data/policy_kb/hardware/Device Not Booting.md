# Device Not Booting

**Category:** Hardware  

## Description
User’s laptop or desktop will not power on or will not pass the initial boot screen.

## Typical Ticket Patterns
- “Laptop won’t turn on / black screen”
- “PC stuck on vendor logo”
- “No response when pressing power button”

## Resolution Steps
1. Confirm the device, power adapter, and dock are connected to a known-good outlet.
2. Ask the user to remove external peripherals (USB drives, docking station, monitors) and retry.
3. Perform a forced power cycle (hold power button 10–15 seconds) and then power on again.
4. Check for indicator lights, fan noise, or beeps; record any error messages on screen.
5. If the device boots into recovery or diagnostics, run the hardware test and capture codes.
6. If disk or memory issues are reported, follow the Hardware Replacement Process to swap parts.
7. Document all steps and outcomes in the ticket.

## When to Escalate
- Device fails vendor diagnostics or cannot reach BIOS/UEFI.
- Critical user (e.g., executive, frontline) without backup hardware.
- Suspected physical damage, liquid damage, or data-recovery needed.
