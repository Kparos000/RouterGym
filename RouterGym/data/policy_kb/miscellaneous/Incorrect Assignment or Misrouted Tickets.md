# Incorrect Assignment or Misrouted Tickets

**Category:** Miscellaneous  

## Description
Tickets opened in the wrong queue or category.

## Typical Ticket Patterns
- “This should go to HR, not IT”
- “Ticket in wrong team’s backlog”
- “Mis-categorised as hardware instead of access”

## Resolution Steps
1. Review ticket description and determine correct category/owner.
2. Update ticket category, priority, and routing group.
3. Add a brief note explaining the reassignment.
4. If pattern emerges (same form mis-routing), raise improvement request to service management.
5. Track reassignment metrics for reporting.

## When to Escalate
- Critical tickets delayed due to repeated mis-routing.
- Workflow or form design causing systemic errors.
- Disputes between teams about ownership.
