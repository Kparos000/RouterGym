# “How-To” Guidance and User Education Requests

**Category:** Miscellaneous  

## Description
Requests that are primarily about learning how to use an existing tool rather than fixing an incident.

## Typical Ticket Patterns
- “How do I share a file in OneDrive?”
- “Best way to set up a team site?”
- “How can I schedule recurring meetings?”

## Resolution Steps
1. Confirm that the tool is functioning correctly (no incident).
2. Provide short, task-focused instructions or links to existing guides.
3. Where questions recur, propose updated FAQ or quick-reference guides.
4. Encourage use of training resources, webinars, or e-learning.
5. Tag ticket as “how-to” for reporting.

## When to Escalate
- Requests for formal training for whole teams.
- Gaps in documentation that need product owner support.
- Tools with frequent how-to issues that may require UX or process changes.
