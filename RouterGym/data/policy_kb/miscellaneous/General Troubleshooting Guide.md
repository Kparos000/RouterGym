# General Troubleshooting Guide

**Category:** Miscellaneous  

## Description
Baseline steps for common IT issues when no specific KB article applies.

## Typical Ticket Patterns
- “System not working – no details”
- “Random error message”
- “User cannot describe exact problem”

## Resolution Steps
1. Clarify symptoms, scope (one user vs many), and recent changes.
2. Ask user to restart affected application or device.
3. Check networking, login status, and basic resource usage.
4. Look for known incidents or outages.
5. If issue becomes specific (e.g., access, storage, hardware), redirect to relevant KB/queue.

## When to Escalate
- Repeated “general” tickets from same system or location.
- Signs of wider incident (multiple users, same error).
- Safety or data-loss risk.
